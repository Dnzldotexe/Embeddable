# Embeddable
Convert your Google Drive link/s to an "embeddable" link for HTML

### Why?
Previously, I developed an app (see my Bawat-Patak repo) for a school project. Along with the app is the User Manual, which I made in Kaggle. Basically, JupyterNotebook/HTML/MarkDown doesn't accept a generic Google Drive link, it needs to be an embed. Or it would look something like this ![Sample Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdwhOTkuc2amndSc_j09c8JzCtL8wr1q/view?usp=drive_link).

### Using the App:
1. The User can visit the App using the link above
![App UI/Landing Page](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1MdwhOTkuc2amndSc_j09c8JzCtL8wr1q)

2. The User can input a single link inside the text area/box
![Single link paste](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_-_cMUlTdBsEJaMxzhPGbMeGxEuR-ZCM)

3. Or, input multiple links in the text area/box, which provides convenience rather than copy and pasting each single link

4. The User can then click the "Convert" button to see the results. That can either be copied (one link at a time) by dragging the cursor over the link. Or, by clicking the Copy to Clipboard icon (all at once).
